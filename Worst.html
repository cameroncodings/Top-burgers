            <p> Calcium <br>
                White bread is fortified with calcium and four medium slices per day would provide over 30% of the recommended daily intake of calcium which we need every day to maintain healthy bones and teeth.
                <br>
                Fibre <br>
                Bread, especially wholemeal, is an important source of dietary fibre which helps to keep our digestive system healthy, helps control blood sugar and cholesterol levels and makes us feel fuller for longer.
                <br>
                Protein <br>
                Bread is a low fat source of protein which is required by our bodies for growth, renewal and repair.
                <br>
                Iron<br>
                White bread is fortified with iron. Iron is important for energy and concentration, a healthy immune system and healthy blood.
                <br>
                Vitamins & Other Minerals<br>
                Bread contains a wide range of vitamins and minerals including B group vitamins thiamine (B1), Niacin (B3) which are important for releasing energy from food and maintaining healthy skin, eyes and nails. It contains the B vitamin Folate (Folic Acid) which is important for pregnancy as it can help to prevent neural tube defects such as spina bifida.
                <br>
                Energy<br>
                Bread is relatively low in calories. An average medium slice of white bread contains 77 calories, brown contains 72 calories and wholemeal contains 79 calories.
                <br>
                Fat<br>
                Bread is a low fat food. An average medium slice of white bread contains 0.6g of fat, brown bread contains 0.7g and wholemeal contains 0.9g. Just be careful with what you put on it and stick to healthy options for spreads and toppings.
                <br>
                Sugar<br>
                Most breads are low in sugar which is important for healthy teeth and maintaining a healthy weight.</p>

            <p> Title: Annoying Orange: A Cinematic Masterpiece of Modern Comedy

                
                In the realm of entertainment, certain creations transcend the boundaries of their initial intentions, captivating audiences and leaving an indelible mark on pop culture. The Annoying Orange, a web series created by Dane Boedigheimer, is one such phenomenon that has managed to achieve cult status and amass a substantial following. Though initially perceived as a simple online gag, the Annoying Orange's unique blend of humor, creativity, and innovative storytelling has propelled it beyond conventional expectations. This essay will explore the elements that make the Annoying Orange a cinematic masterpiece, arguing that it is not just an annoyance, but rather a creative and comedic triumph.
                
                At first glance, the idea of a talking, anthropomorphic orange might seem preposterous and immature. However, it is precisely this unconventional concept that sets the stage for the Annoying Orange's comedic brilliance. The humor derives from its absurdity, as viewers are presented with a whimsical and unexpected world where fruits and vegetables come to life. This playful absurdity opens the doors to a myriad of creative scenarios and puns, making the audience laugh at the most unlikely of jokes.
                
                
                A central component of any successful comedy is the dynamic between its characters. The Annoying Orange manages to craft a diverse and engaging cast, each with their own distinct quirks and personalities. Whether it's the playful Orange, the enigmatic Grapefruit, or the neurotic Pear, every character plays off one another in a way that elevates the humor and adds depth to the storytelling. This interplay creates a charming and memorable ensemble that keeps viewers eagerly awaiting each episode.
                
                
                One of the reasons the Annoying Orange stands out as a cinematic masterpiece is its innovative storytelling format. Utilizing a combination of live-action and animation, the series manages to blur the lines between the real and the imaginary, creating a captivating viewing experience. This hybrid approach not only showcases the creators' technical prowess but also enhances the comedic timing and delivery of jokes, further reinforcing its status as a unique and groundbreaking work.
                
                Beneath its seemingly frivolous surface, the Annoying Orange occasionally ventures into satirical territory. The series provides clever commentary on various aspects of modern life, often making light of pop culture, internet trends, and societal norms. This subtle satire allows the show to connect with its audience on a deeper level, offering both humor and insight into contemporary society.
                
                
                What started as a simple web series with straightforward humor has evolved into something more complex and sophisticated over time. As the show progressed, it incorporated multi-episode story arcs, character development, and even occasional emotional moments. This evolution showcases the creators' commitment to continually push the boundaries of their creation, demonstrating that the Annoying Orange is more than just a one-dimensional comedic act.
                
                
                The longevity and enduring popularity of the Annoying Orange are testament to its cinematic brilliance. It has managed to build a massive online fanbase, with millions of subscribers and billions of views across various platforms. Such widespread appeal speaks to the universal nature of its humor and its ability to resonate with viewers of all ages.
                
                
                In conclusion, the Annoying Orange has rightfully earned its place as a cinematic masterpiece of modern comedy. Its unconventional concept, dynamic character interplay, innovative storytelling format, satirical commentary, evolving complexity, and enduring popularity all contribute to its status as a creative and comedic triumph. The Annoying Orange challenges the traditional notions of entertainment and has successfully transcended its initial origins as a mere online gag, leaving a lasting impact on pop culture. As a result, the Annoying Orange stands as a shining example of the power of creativity and humor in captivating audiences worldwide.</p>
